synthetic_short_gene_example trains the model using synthetic data corresponding to a 'short' gene length / window size - this means that the example can be run on a laptop in around 5 minutes.

synthetic_long_gene_example is similar to above, but with a longer gene.

hoppe_et_al_ush_real_data_example uses experimental Drosophila data from Hoppe et al.

reproduce_paper_figures produces the plots of running time comparison and parameter convergence from the paper.
